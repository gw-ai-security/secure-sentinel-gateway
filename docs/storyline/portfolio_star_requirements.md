# Portfolio Storyline - Requirements Engineering

## Situation
Multiple stakeholders needed AI functionality, but requirements were fragmented and lacked clear acceptance criteria.

## Task
Produce a structured requirements specification that balances security, compliance, and operational needs.

## Action
Defined system scope, functional and non-functional requirements, and created role-specific user stories with acceptance criteria.

## Result
Delivered a clear, testable requirements baseline that guides architecture and compliance work without implementation detail.

## Learning
Precise requirements reduce downstream rework and improve traceability across security and compliance domains.
