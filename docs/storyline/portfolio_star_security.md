# Portfolio Storyline - Security Controls

## Situation
Enterprise systems needed to use LLMs, but prompt injection and data leakage risks made direct access unsafe.

## Task
Define gateway-level security controls that prevent abuse while preserving auditability.

## Action
Established requirements for prompt injection detection, PII masking, and response filtering, and linked them to monitoring and tamper-evident logging to support audit readiness.

## Result
Created a clear, testable security requirements baseline that enables safe AI adoption without embedding security logic into every application.

## Learning
Effective AI security starts with a single control point and explicit risk-to-control mapping.
