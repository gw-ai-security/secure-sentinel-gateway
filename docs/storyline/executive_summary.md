# Executive Summary

Secure Sentinel AI Gateway (SSG) is a centralized governance layer that sits between enterprise systems and approved LLM providers to enforce security, compliance, and auditability for AI interactions. It standardizes request and response handling so AI usage can scale without scattering risk controls across every application. The project exists because prompt abuse, data leakage, and regulatory obligations have made ad hoc AI adoption a material enterprise risk. Unlike typical AI projects, SSG is documentation-first and governance-driven, prioritizing traceability, evidence, and risk ownership over implementation detail. It demonstrates the work of AI architecture, AI security, compliance leadership, DevOps oversight, and program governance roles working as a coordinated delivery team. The current maturity level is a governance-ready foundation, and the next logical phase is to validate the conceptual architecture and operationalize monitoring and incident response.
