# Project Readiness Review - Phase 1 Closeout

## Summary of project status
Phase 1 requirements are complete and traceable to the Knowledge Base. Security, compliance, and governance expectations are documented at a high level and aligned to the gateway scope. Work reporting and Knowledge Base practices are in place for auditability.

## Preconditions met
- Requirements include functional and non-functional controls with role-specific acceptance criteria.
- Knowledge Base references are embedded in requirements and key artifacts.
- EU AI Act mappings exist at a high level with evidence linkage.
- Work reporting standards and role logs are established for Phase 1.
- Phase 1 artifacts are documented and traceable.

## Open risks and assumptions
- Assumption: Scope remains limited to a gateway control plane and excludes model hosting or application logic.
- Risk: EU AI Act mappings are high-level and may require refinement once architecture and threat modeling start.
- Risk: Threat register is initial and must be expanded during Phase 2.
- Risk: Operational monitoring expectations are not yet validated against a concrete architecture.

## Recommendation
Conditional Go.

## Rationale for recommendation
Phase 1 deliverables meet baseline governance and traceability requirements, but Phase 2 must expand threats and validate mappings against architecture and deployment assumptions.

## Phase 2 mandate (Architecture and Threat Modeling)
- Produce architecture boundary notes and data flow assumptions without implementation details.
- Expand the threat register using STRIDE or LINDDUN and map threats to security patterns.
- Refine EU AI Act mappings based on architecture and threat outcomes.
- Validate monitoring, logging, and evidence requirements against the Phase 2 architecture notes.
- Update Knowledge Base entries and work reports for all contributing roles.
