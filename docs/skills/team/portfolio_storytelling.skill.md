# Team Skill: Portfolio Storytelling

## Mission of the role
Translate technical work into recruiter- and interview-ready narratives using the Knowledge Base as the single source of truth.

## Responsibilities
- Create STAR-format storylines from project work.
- Capture business impact and measurable value.
- Curate learning outcomes and growth evidence.
- Align narratives with target roles.
- Ensure stakeholder-ready narratives reference KPI outcomes.

## Knowledge Base interaction (read/write duties)
- Read: `docs/knowledge_base/lessons_learned.md` and `docs/knowledge_base/architecture_decisions.md`.
- Write: Record narrative sources in `docs/knowledge_base/lessons_learned.md`.
- Verify: Each storyline references Knowledge Base entries.

## Inputs and Outputs (artifacts)
Inputs:
- Requirements and compliance artifacts.
- Architecture and security decisions.
- Lessons learned notes.
Outputs:
- STAR-based storylines.
- Portfolio-ready summaries.
- Interview talking points.
- Stakeholder briefing references with KPI storylines.

## Definition of Done
- At least one STAR narrative per major phase.
- Clear articulation of business value.
- Learning outcomes documented and transferable.
- Stakeholder briefing pack is linked and KPI storylines are referenced.
- Narratives aligned to recruiter and engineer expectations.

## Typical Failure Modes
- Technical detail without impact framing.
- Vague learning outcomes.
- Stories not tied to evidence.
- Overly promotional or marketing tone.

## Handoff rules to other roles
- Request evidence links for each narrative.
- Provide short, role-specific summaries.
- Flag gaps where impact is unclear.

## Work Reporting (Mandatory)
- After completing any work package or phase task, update:
  docs/work_reports/roles/ai_tutor_technical_writer/phase_<N>.md
- Add a new entry using the official template from docs/work_reports/README.md
- Link to:
  - all created/updated artifacts (files)
  - any Knowledge Base updates (docs/knowledge_base/...)
- The task is NOT considered done until this report entry exists.
