# Knowledge Base - Secure Sentinel AI Gateway

## Purpose
The Knowledge Base is the single source of truth for this project. Every phase must update at least one Knowledge Base file, and every major decision must be traceable to an entry here.

## Structure
- `architecture_overview.md`: Conceptual system overview for recruiter-friendly context.
- `security_patterns.md`: Registry of security controls and patterns.
- `eu_ai_act_mapping.md`: High-level mapping of controls to EU AI Act obligations.
- `threat_register.md`: Structured list of threats and mitigations.
- `architecture_decisions.md`: ADR-style decisions and rationale.
- `risk_ownership_and_escalation.md`: Risk ownership, escalation triggers, and decision authority.
- `lessons_learned.md`: Learning outcomes and rationale summaries.

## Update rules
- Each phase adds or updates at least one entry.
- Entries must include a clear rationale and link to requirements.
- Avoid duplication across files; reference existing entries instead.
- Update dates and ownership where appropriate.

## Ownership
The Knowledge Base Curator ensures consistency and completeness across all files.
