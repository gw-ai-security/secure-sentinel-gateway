# Security Patterns Registry

## Purpose
Provide a stable registry of AI gateway security controls and patterns used for traceability and risk management.

## Patterns
- SP-01: Prompt injection detection and rejection.
- SP-02: Sensitive data masking before outbound requests.
- SP-03: Response filtering to prevent data leakage.
- SP-04: Policy enforcement with per-tenant rules.
- SP-05: Anomaly detection for abuse and misuse.

## Traceability notes
Each pattern should map to at least one requirement and one threat in the threat register.
