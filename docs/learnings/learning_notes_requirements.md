# Learning Notes - Requirements Foundations

## Key takeaways
- A gateway model centralizes AI policy enforcement and keeps business logic outside the control plane.
- Functional requirements must explicitly include security and auditability to be testable.
- Non-functional requirements drive compliance readiness and operational safeguards.

## Rationale highlights
- System scope excludes model hosting and application logic to keep the gateway focused on control and oversight.
- User stories for architecture, security, and compliance keep role expectations explicit.

## Transferable lessons
- Write acceptance criteria for each role to avoid interpretation gaps.
- Traceability should be designed into requirements, not added later.
