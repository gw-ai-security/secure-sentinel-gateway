# Learning Notes - Security and Compliance Alignment

## Key takeaways
- Prompt injection and data leakage must be addressed as first-class requirements.
- Auditability is a functional need, not just an operational concern.
- Governance and oversight are required to satisfy organizational compliance needs.

## Rationale highlights
- Security controls were tied to specific risks and mapped to compliance obligations at a high level.
- Evidence artifacts were defined early to reduce audit friction later.

## Transferable lessons
- High-level control mapping supports compliance without locking into implementation.
- Logging and monitoring requirements should be explicit in the requirements baseline.
